> Patrick Naylor, Thomas Lunner, Maarten de Vos, Tobias May  

## Abstract information
Contributions within the current symposium topic will be given priority. Other contributions within the general fields of auditory and audiological research are also welcome for poster presentation.

Two types of contributions will be considered:

CONTRIBUTED PAPERS: Contributed oral presentations will be 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions.
POSTERS: Poster will be on display during all days. There will be poster sessions Wednesday and Thursday and social activities in the poster area in the evenings.

Abstract deadline 01 May 2019.

Contributions will be evaluated by the organizing committee. Notification of acceptance/rejection as well as presentation type will be given by 10 June 2019. Authors of accepted presentations and posters will be given the opportunity to submit a written version (max 8 pages) that will be published in the online symposium proceedings.

Authors of manuscripts accepted for publication in the conference proceedings will also have the opportunity to submit an extended version of their conference paper to open-access journal Trends in Hearing. Manuscripts will be peer-reviewed in accordance with the journal policies and accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the journal.

## Instructions for authors

Manuscripts from both oral and poster presentations will be published open-access in the online proceedings after the symposium. Manuscripts must be delivered to the organizers via electronic submission no later than 15 September 2019.

### Manuscript template
For lay-out of manuscripts, authors must follow one of the following templates available for download below:
- (MS Word)[files/isaar_2019_manuscript_template_msword.docx]
- (LaTeX)[files/isaar_2019_manuscript_template_latex.zip]

Formatting instructions are given in the default template text. The manuscripts of the invited speakers are limited to 12 pages including figures. Contributed papers (including poster presentations) are restricted to 8 pages including the figures.

All references should be in formatted as indicated in the manuscript template and DOIs should be provided for each reference when available.

### Manuscript submission
All manuscripts must be submitted electronically in two copies:

One copy in .docx or .tex format, corresponding to one of the above templates
One copy in .pdf format, where total page length does not exceed 8 pages (12 pages for invited contributions)
All figure files must also be provided separately.

For all manuscripts submitted in .tex format, bibliography files must also be provided if references have not been included in the .tex file.

Manuscripts must be submitted from the Manuscript Submission page.

### Poster guidelines
Poster format must be portrait/vertical (max. 1.57 m high and 1.15 m wide). Possibility for mains connection (230 V AC).

Here are a few poster formatting tips:

- The outline of the posters should be kept simple and clear.
- Vertical columns are preferable to a horizontal row format.
- The text should be as concise as possible but sufficient such that the poster is self-explanatory.
- Complex details should be left for discussion during the poster session.
- Figures and tables should be accompanied by an explanatory caption, clearly labeled with a number sequence following the order in which they appear on the poster, and referenced to in the poster text.
- Graphs should be kept as minimalistic as possible so that they illustrate a specific point and are devoid of redundant information.
- Section headings should be kept simple (e.g., “Introduction”, “Methods”, “Results”, “Discussion”, etc.).
- The abstract can be left out of the poster.
- Font sizes should be large enough so that they are readable from a distance of 1 to 2.5 meters. Appropriate font size values are about 96 pt (title), 48 pt (headings), and 24 pt (regular text, table contents, figure labels, captions, legends, etc.).

## About
ISAAR - International Symposium on Auditory and Audiological Research - is formerly known as "Danavox Symposium".

The "Danavox Jubilee Foundation" was established in 1968 on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of GN Danavox. The object of the Foundation is to support and encourage audiological research and development.

Funds are donated by GN Hearing (the former GN Danavox) and are managed by a board consisting of hearing science specialists who are entirely independent of GN Hearing.

Since the establishment in 1968 the resources of the Foundation have been used to support a series of symposia, at which a large number of outstanding scientists from all over the world have given lectures, presented posters and participated in discussions on various audiological topics.

From 2007 the symposia have the common name ISAAR - International Symposium on Auditory and Audiological Research.
